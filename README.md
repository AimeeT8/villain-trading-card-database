# villain-trading-card-database
This app lets users collect digital supervillain trading cards, like baseball cards, but with a villainous twist. Users will be able to add their own villains including names, descriptions, photos, interests, and special powers. Used Python, Flask, SQL to create the database(SQLAlchemy), and HTTP methods to render cards from the database to the front-end.
